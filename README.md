# Ayyam Profile Screen Clone

## Description
A React Native UI task to clone Ayyam’s profile screen, featuring a tappable profile picture that expands to fill the screen. This project demonstrates how to use React Native Gesture Handler for smooth animations and pure `StyleSheet` code for styling.

- **Expandable Avatar**  
  Tappable profile picture that smoothly expands to full-screen and collapses back.
- **Pure `StyleSheet` Styling**  
  All styles are written with React Native’s built-in `StyleSheet` API—no external UI libraries.
